                <p>
                My brain tends to shut when I'm with my mum, because it makes me a pushover.
                I'm unlearning this.And I'm sorry I didn't wait a couple more minutes considering I miss you so so much.
                </p>
                <p>This is the most I can do for now as a broke college-dropout who's new to coding.I know I can do better but I'm trusting that I'll make it up.
                    Consider this as my pledge to make it up to you.
                </p>
